      "content": "The average height of women in Lebanon is approximately 159-160 cm (about 5'3\" or 5'3.5\").\n\nThis figure is based on various demographic and health studies, though exact measurements can vary slightly between different sources and time periods. Lebanon's average female height is generally consistent with regional averages in the Middle East and is similar to many Mediterranean countries.\n\nIt's worth noting that average heights can change over time due to factors like nutrition, healthcare improvements, and socioeconomic conditions, so these figures represent recent estimates rather than fixed values."

      "content": "The average height of men in Lebanon is approximately 174-175 cm (about 5'8.5\" to 5'9\").\n\nThis makes Lebanese men roughly 14-15 cm (about 5.5-6 inches) taller than Lebanese women on average, which is typical for the gender height difference seen in most populations worldwide.\n\nLike with women's heights, these figures are based on demographic studies and health surveys, and the exact numbers can vary slightly between different sources. Men's average height in Lebanon is also generally consistent with regional averages in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean region."

      "content": "Conor McGregor's height is approximately 175 cm (5'9\").\n\nThis is his officially listed height, though as with many athletes and celebrities, there can sometimes be slight variations in reported measurements across different sources. McGregor is considered to be of average to slightly above-average height for a male, and his height has been well-suited for his fighting career in the UFC's lightweight and featherweight divisions."

      "content": "Khabib Nurmagomedov's height is approximately 178 cm (5'10\").\n\nThis makes him slightly taller than Conor McGregor by about 3 cm (roughly 1 inch). Khabib's height was well-suited for his wrestling-heavy fighting style in the UFC's lightweight division, where he had a successful career before retiring undefeated with a 29-0 record."

      "content": "Daniel Cormier's height is approximately 180 cm (5'11\").\n\nCormier competed in both the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions in the UFC, where his height was considered relatively short for those weight classes - especially at heavyweight where many fighters are 6'2\" (188 cm) or taller. Despite any height disadvantages, his wrestling skills, athleticism, and fight IQ made him a two-division UFC champion and one of the most successful fighters in MMA history."
