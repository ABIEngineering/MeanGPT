Yes, I'm confident in the figure:\n\nLebanon's area is **10,452 km²**, which converts to **10,452,000,000 m²** (10.452 billion square meters).\n\nThis is the commonly cited official area. Lebanon is indeed a small country - it's about 210 km long (north to south) and varies from about 25-90 km wide (east to west).\n\nIs there a particular reason you're questioning this figure? If you've seen a different number somewhere, I'd be happy to discuss any discrepancies."
