      "content": "The steam engine was not invented by a single individual but evolved over time through the contributions of several inventors. However, Thomas Savery is often credited with creating one of the first practical steam engines in 1698, known as the \"Miner's Friend,\" which was used to pump water out of mines. Later, Thomas Newcomen improved upon this design in 1712 with the atmospheric steam engine, which was more efficient for pumping water.\n\nThe most significant advancement came from James Watt, a Scottish engineer, who in 1765 developed a more efficient steam engine by adding a separate condenser, greatly improving fuel efficiency and power output. Watt's innovations made the steam engine a key driver of the Industrial Revolution, powering machinery, locomotives, and ships. While Watt did not invent the steam engine, he is often associated with it due to his transformative improvements."
