      "content": "The development of the steam engine was a gradual process with contributions from several inventors. The earliest practical steam engine was invented by Thomas Savery in 1698, known as the \"fire engine,\" which was used for pumping water. Later, in 1712, Thomas Newcomen developed a more advanced atmospheric steam engine, which also primarily served to pump water out of mines.\n\nJames Watt significantly improved the steam engine in the late 18th century by introducing a separate condenser, which greatly increased efficiency. His enhancements in the 1760s and 1770s transformed the steam engine into a powerful and practical source of industrial power, playing a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution."
