      "content": "Theodore Maiman is widely credited with inventing the first working laser in 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories.\n\nHowever, the theoretical principles that led to the laser were developed earlier by **Charles Townes** and **Arthur Schawlow**, who published their work in 1958 and received a patent. **Gordon Gould** also made significant independent contributions and coined the acronym \"LASER\" (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).\n\nTherefore, while Maiman built the first functional device, the invention of the laser involved the contributions of several scientists."
