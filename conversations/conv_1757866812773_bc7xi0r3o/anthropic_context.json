      "content": "The laser was invented by **Theodore Maiman** in 1960. He created the first working laser at Hughes Research Laboratories in California, using a ruby crystal as the lasing medium.\n\nHowever, the theoretical foundation for lasers was laid earlier by **Albert Einstein** in 1917 with his theory of stimulated emission. The acronym \"LASER\" (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) was coined by **Gordon Gould** in 1957, who also contributed significantly to laser development, though his patent battles with other inventors lasted for decades.\n\nOther key contributors include **Charles Townes** and **Arthur Schawlow**, who published important theoretical work on optical lasers in 1958 and shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1981 for their contributions to laser spectroscopy."
