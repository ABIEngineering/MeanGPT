      "content": "The average renting cost of a studio apartment in Koumassi, a commune in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, typically ranges between **50,000 to 100,000 CFA francs per month** (approximately $80 to $160 USD, depending on exchange rates). Prices can vary based on factors such as the exact location within Koumassi, the condition of the apartment, amenities (like water, electricity, or security), and proximity to markets or public transport.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, as rental prices fluctuate with demand and inflation. It's advisable to consult local real estate agents or online platforms like **Jumia House Côte d'Ivoire** or local Facebook groups for the most current listings and to negotiate directly with landlords. Additionally, some rentals may require a deposit (caution) of 2-3 months' rent upfront, along with agency fees if you use a broker."

      "content": "The average renting cost of a 1-bedroom apartment, commonly referred to as a \"chambre salon\" (a bedroom and living room setup) in Koumassi, Abidjan, typically ranges between **80,000 to 150,000 CFA francs per month** (approximately $130 to $245 USD, depending on exchange rates). As with studio apartments, the price can vary based on factors such as the specific neighborhood within Koumassi, the condition of the apartment, available amenities (like water, electricity, or security), and proximity to key areas like markets or transport hubs.\n\nThese are approximate figures, and actual costs may differ due to market demand or inflation. I recommend checking local real estate platforms like **Jumia House Côte d'Ivoire**, visiting the area, or connecting with local agents for the most up-to-date listings. Be prepared for additional costs such as a deposit (caution) of 2-3 months' rent and potential agency fees if using a broker."
