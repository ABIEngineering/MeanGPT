      "content": "At the time being, the **Gemini 1.5 Pro** model is generally considered the best Gemini API model for most advanced use cases.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Massive Context Window:** It supports up to 1 million tokens (and 2 million in private preview), allowing it to process extremely long documents, codebases, or videos.\n*   **Multimodal Capabilities:** It can natively understand and reason across text, images, audio, and video inputs.\n*   **Enhanced Performance:** It offers significant improvements in reasoning, code generation, and complex task handling compared to previous versions.\n\nWhile other models like **Gemini 1.5 Flash** are optimized for speed and cost-efficiency for simpler tasks, **Gemini 1.5 Pro** provides the highest capabilities and versatility for complex applications."
