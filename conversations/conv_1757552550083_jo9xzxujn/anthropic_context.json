Let me verify this more carefully.\n\nLebanon's area is approximately **10,400 square kilometers** (this is the most commonly cited figure, though sources may vary slightly between 10,230-10,452 km²).\n\nConverting to square meters:\n10,400 km² × 1,000,000 m²/km² = **10,400,000,000 m²**\n\nSo Lebanon has an area of approximately **10.4 billion square meters**.\n\nThe exact figure can vary slightly depending on the source, but 10.4 billion m² is a reliable estimate."
