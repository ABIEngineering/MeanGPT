      "content": "The Stirling engine was invented by Robert Stirling, a Scottish clergyman and engineer, in 1816. He developed it as a safer alternative to steam engines, which often exploded due to high pressure. The Stirling engine operates on a closed-cycle system using external heat sources to expand and contract a gas, typically air or helium, to produce mechanical work."
