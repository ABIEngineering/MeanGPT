      "content": "Trigonometry wasn't invented by a single person, but rather developed gradually over thousands of years by multiple civilizations:\n\n**Ancient Babylonians (c. 1900-1600 BCE)**: Created the earliest known trigonometric tables and developed the base-60 number system still used for measuring angles.\n\n**Ancient Egyptians and Greeks**: Made significant contributions, with **Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190-120 BCE)** often called the \"father of trigonometry\" for creating the first comprehensive trigonometric tables.\n\n**Indian mathematicians**: Made crucial advances, including:\n- **Aryabhata (476-550 CE)**: Developed sine tables\n- **Brahmagupta (628 CE)**: Advanced trigonometric concepts\n\n**Islamic mathematicians (8th-10th centuries)**: Significantly expanded trigonometry, with scholars like **Al-Battani** and **Al-Biruni** developing more sophisticated methods.\n\n**Medieval and Renaissance Europeans**: Further refined and systematized trigonometry into the form we recognize today.\n\nSo while trigonometry has ancient roots, it's the result of collaborative development across many cultures and centuries rather than the work of a single inventor."
