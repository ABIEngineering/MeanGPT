      "content": "Trigonometry, as a branch of mathematics dealing with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, was not invented by a single individual but developed over time by various ancient civilizations. Its origins can be traced back to ancient Egypt and Babylon, where basic geometric principles were used for surveying and astronomy.\n\nHowever, the systematic study of trigonometry as we know it today is often credited to the ancient Greek mathematician **Hipparchus of Nicaea** (c. 190–120 BCE). Hipparchus is considered the \"father of trigonometry\" because he created the first known trigonometric table, which related the lengths of the sides of a triangle to its angles. He used these tables for astronomical calculations, particularly to predict the positions of celestial bodies.\n\nLater, the Indian mathematician and astronomer **Aryabhata** (476–550 CE) and other scholars in India made significant contributions by introducing the concept of sine and cosine. Their work was further developed by Islamic mathematicians like **Al-Battani** (c. 858–929 CE), who refined trigonometric functions and their applications in astronomy.\n\nIn summary, while Hipparchus laid the foundational work for trigonometry, it evolved through contributions from multiple cultures over centuries."
