      "content": "The laser was invented by Theodore H. Maiman, an American physicist. He successfully created the first working laser on May 16, 1960, at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California, using a synthetic ruby crystal to produce a beam of coherent light. However, the theoretical foundation for the laser was based on earlier work by scientists like Albert Einstein, who developed the concept of stimulated emission in 1917, and Charles H. Townes, who, along with Arthur L. Schawlow, described the principles of the laser in a 1958 paper. Townes had also developed the maser (a precursor to the laser) in 1953. Maiman is credited with building the first operational laser."
